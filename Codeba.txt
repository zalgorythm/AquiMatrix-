Detailed File Descriptions
The following table provides an exhaustive description of each file in the AquiMatrix system, with additional details beyond previous iterations to offer deeper insight into their roles, implementation considerations, and interactions with other components.
File Name	Description
/data_ingestion/entry_validator.py	This file is responsible for the initial validation of all incoming entries submitted to the AquiMatrix network. It performs a multi-step validation process: (1) Schema Validation: Ensures the entry adheres to a predefined structure (e.g., contains required fields like timestamp, predecessor hashes, transaction data, and signature). (2) Signature Verification: Uses the cryptographic_functions.py library to verify the ECDSA signature against the submitter’s public key, ensuring authenticity and integrity. (3) Timestamp Check: Confirms the timestamp is within an acceptable range (e.g., not too far in the future or past relative to the node’s clock, adjusted for network latency). (4) Duplicate Detection: Checks against the database (via database_access.py) to prevent reprocessing of already-seen entries. If any check fails, the entry is rejected with an error code, logged, and reported back to the submitter via the API. This file is critical for maintaining the system’s security and data integrity at the ingestion layer.
/pof_solver/hash_target_solver.py	Implements the core hash-target puzzle of the Proof of Fractal (PoF) consensus mechanism. It operates as follows: (1) Aggregate Hash Computation: Combines the entry’s data—predecessor hashes (three references), timestamp, transaction payload, state root, and submitter’s public key—into an aggregate hash using SHA-256 (via cryptographic_functions.py). (2) Nonce Iteration: Appends a nonce to the aggregate hash and computes a final hash, iterating the nonce until the result is below a target value defined in pof_parameters.json. (3) Target Validation: Compares the final hash (as a 256-bit integer) against the current difficulty target, which is dynamically adjusted by difficulty_adjustment.py. This process mirrors proof-of-work but is paired with a pattern similarity condition (handled by pattern_similarity_checker.py) to form the PoF mechanism. The solver logs computational effort for monitoring and debugging purposes.
/pof_solver/pattern_similarity_checker.py	Enforces the bit-pattern similarity condition unique to the PoF validation process, adding complexity beyond traditional hash-based puzzles. It performs: (1) Predecessor Hash Aggregation: Computes a SHA-256 hash of the concatenated predecessor hashes (from the three referenced entries). (2) XOR Operation: Calculates the bitwise XOR between this predecessor hash and the final hash from hash_target_solver.py. (3) Hamming Distance Check: Extracts a prefix (length k bits, defined in pof_parameters.json) from the XOR result and a suffix (same length) from the predecessor hash concatenation, then computes their Hamming distance (number of differing bits). (4) Threshold Validation: Ensures the Hamming distance is below a mismatch tolerance (δ), also set in pof_parameters.json. This dual-condition approach (hash target + pattern similarity) aims to balance computational difficulty with resistance to ASIC optimization, though its exact security implications are still theoretical.
/pof_solver/difficulty_adjustment.py	Dynamically tunes the PoF difficulty to maintain a stable entry rate across the network. It operates on a feedback loop: (1) Solve Time Monitoring: Tracks the average time to solve PoF puzzles over the last M entries (M configurable in pof_parameters.json), using timestamps stored in the DAG via dag_structure.py. (2) Target Adjustment: Updates the hash target every M entries to achieve a target solve time (τ, e.g., 10 seconds), increasing the target (lowering difficulty) if solve times exceed τ, or decreasing it (raising difficulty) if below τ. (3) Pattern Parameter Tuning: Adjusts the bit-length (k) and mismatch tolerance (δ) for the pattern similarity condition based on network hash rate and solver performance metrics. This file interacts with database_access.py to store historical difficulty data and ensures smooth operation under varying network conditions (e.g., node count changes or hardware upgrades).
/vm_state/stack_vm.py	Implements a stack-based virtual machine (VM) for executing smart contracts on AquiMatrix. Key features include: (1) Stack Operations: Maintains a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) stack for data manipulation, supporting push (add item) and pop (remove item) operations. (2) Opcode Execution: Interprets and executes opcodes defined in opcode_library.py, such as arithmetic (ADD, MUL), storage (SSTORE), and control flow (JUMP). (3) Gas Metering: Tracks gas usage per operation via gas_accounting.py, halting execution if the gas limit (from vm_gas_limits.json) is exceeded. (4) Determinism: Ensures identical execution across all nodes by avoiding floating-point operations and using fixed-precision arithmetic. The VM processes transaction payloads containing bytecode, updating the state trie (state_trie.py) upon completion. It’s designed for simplicity and security, with error handling for stack underflows or invalid opcodes.
/vm_state/opcode_library.py	Defines the full instruction set for the VM, providing the building blocks for smart contract logic. It includes: (1) Arithmetic Opcodes: ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, each with gas costs (e.g., ADD costs 3 gas, MUL 5 gas, per vm_gas_limits.json). (2) Logical Opcodes: AND, OR, NOT, for bitwise operations. (3) Storage Opcodes: SSTORE (write to state trie, 200 gas) and SLOAD (read from state trie, 50 gas). (4) Control Opcodes: JUMP, JUMPI (conditional jump), CALL (invoke another contract). Each opcode is implemented as a Python function with input validation and gas cost assignment. The library is extensible, allowing future additions (e.g., cryptographic opcodes) via updates to this file and corresponding gas limits. It’s tightly coupled with stack_vm.py for execution and gas_accounting.py for cost tracking.
/vm_state/gas_accounting.py	Manages resource usage during smart contract execution by tracking gas consumption and calculating fees. It: (1) Initializes Gas: Sets the available gas based on the transaction’s gas limit (user-specified, capped by vm_gas_limits.json). (2) Tracks Usage: Deducts gas for each opcode executed, as defined in opcode_library.py, plus a base fee (e.g., 21,000 gas) for transaction overhead. (3) Fee Calculation: Multiplies total gas used by the gas price (in AquiMatrix tokens, set by the submitter) to determine the fee, paid to validators. (4) Enforcement: Halts execution if gas runs out, reverting state changes (via state_trie.py) but retaining the fee for computational effort. It logs gas usage for debugging and provides metrics to difficulty_adjustment.py for network tuning. This prevents denial-of-service attacks and incentivizes efficient contract design.
/vm_state/state_trie.py	Manages the Merkle Patricia Trie (MPT), a data structure storing the state of all smart contracts. It: (1) State Storage: Maps contract addresses and storage keys to values (e.g., balances, variables) in a key-value store. (2) State Updates: Applies changes from contract execution (via stack_vm.py), creating new trie nodes as needed. (3) Root Computation: Calculates the state root (a SHA-256 hash of the trie’s root node) after each update, stored in each entry for verification. (4) Efficiency: Uses path compression and branching to minimize storage and lookup costs. (5) Verification: Allows nodes to verify state integrity by recomputing the root from shared data. It integrates with database_access.py for persistence and consensus_engine components for state consistency across the DAG. The MPT ensures tamper-proof, efficient state management critical to the system’s trust model.
/consensus_engine/dag_structure.py	Maintains the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that serves as AquiMatrix’s ledger. It: (1) Entry Addition: Adds new entries, ensuring each references exactly three valid predecessors (checked via entry_validator.py). (2) Acyclicity: Enforces a directed, acyclic structure by validating timestamps (newer entries can’t reference older ones out of order). (3) Graph Integrity: Uses database_access.py to store the DAG and detect orphaned or invalid references. (4) Traversal: Provides functions for traversing the DAG to compute weights (weight_accumulation.py) or resolve conflicts (conflict_resolver.py). The DAG’s structure allows parallel entry processing, improving throughput compared to linear blockchains, with each entry linking to predecessors to build a web of trust.
/consensus_engine/confirmation_levels.py	Assigns confirmation levels to entries in the DAG, indicating their degree of finality. It: (1) Level Assignment: Starts entries at L=0 (unconfirmed), advancing to L=1, L=2, etc., as they gain references from subsequent entries. (2) Weight Thresholds: Uses weight_accumulation.py to check if an entry’s accumulated weight exceeds level-specific thresholds (e.g., 100 for L=1, 1000 for L=2). (3) Multi-Level Logic: Implements a tiered confirmation system where higher levels require more references and weight, configurable in network_config.json. (4) Finality: Marks entries as “final” at a high level (e.g., L=3), after which they’re immutable. This file interacts with dag_structure.py for reference data and state_synchronization.py to propagate confirmation status, ensuring network-wide agreement.
/consensus_engine/weight_accumulation.py	Calculates the accumulated weight of DAG entries to assess their validity and confirmation status. It: (1) Base Weight: Assigns each entry an initial weight (e.g., 1, tied to the submitter’s stake or a fixed value). (2) Reference Weight: Adds weight from each subsequent entry that references it, recursively summing across the DAG. (3) Level-Specific Calculation: Computes weights per confirmation level (e.g., direct references for L=1, second-degree references for L=2), using thresholds from confirmation_levels.py. (4) Storage: Updates weights in the database via database_access.py. This mechanism ensures that widely referenced entries gain trust, supporting conflict resolution and finality in the consensus process.
/consensus_engine/conflict_resolver.py	Resolves conflicts in the DAG, such as double-spends, by selecting the most trusted branch. It: (1) Conflict Detection: Identifies conflicting entries (e.g., two entries spending the same token) via transaction payload analysis. (2) Branch Scoring: Computes a score for each conflicting branch based on accumulated weight (weight_accumulation.py) and economic stake (e.g., tokens locked by submitters). (3) Resolution: Selects the branch with the highest score, marking the losing branch as invalid. (4) Logging: Records resolution decisions for auditability. This file ensures the network converges on a single truth, interacting with dag_structure.py for graph data and state_trie.py to revert invalid state changes. It’s critical for maintaining ledger consistency.

/api_gateway/websocket_server.py	Manages WebSocket connections for real-time updates. It: (1) Subscriptions: Allows clients to subscribe to events (e.g., /ws/new_entries, /ws/state_changes) via a WebSocket handshake. (2) Event Broadcasting: Pushes updates (e.g., new entry hashes, confirmation level changes) to subscribed clients as they occur, sourced from dag_structure.py and confirmation_levels.py. (3) Persistence: Maintains connection state with timeouts (configurable in network_config.json).
